				<div class='asi_inst_heads'>Introducing the ASI</div>

				<p>
					Introduce and explain the seven potential problem areas: Medical, Employment/Support Status, Alcohol, Drug, Legal, Family/Social, and Psychiatric. All clients receive this same standard interview. All information gathered is confidential; explain what that means in your facility; who has access to the information and the process for the release of information.
					<br><br>
					<b><em>There are two time periods we will discuss:</em></b>
					<li>The past 30 days</li>
					<li>Lifetime</li>
					<br>
					Patient Rating Scale: Patient input is important. For each area, I will ask you to use this scale to let me know how bothered you have been by any problems in each section. I will also ask you how important treatment is for you for the area being discussed.<br><br>
					<b><em>The scale is:</em></b>
					<li><b>0</b> - Not at all</li>
					<li><b>1</b> - Slightly</li>
					<li><b>2</b> - Moderately</li>
					<li><b>3</b> - Considerably</li>
					<li><b>4</b> - Extremely</li>
					<br>
					Inform the client that he/she has the right to refuse to answer any question. If the client is uncomfortable or feels it is too personal or painful to give an answer, instruct the client not to answer. Explain the benefits and advantages of answering as many questions as possible in terms of developing a comprehensive and effective treatment plan to help them.
